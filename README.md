| Stealth Mode & Cloak Options | ✅               | ❌                | ❌                |

| UI/Hotkey Control            | ✅               | ⚠️               | ❌                |

Most “trainers” just give you health or cash. This one builds a full-on *mod engine* around how Shadows is meant to be played... but in beast mode 😤.
